    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        There are two main steps to making a pizza. The first is making the crust. Which usually take longer than the other step.
        The second step is the toppings. <br>Usually tomato sauce and cheese (plus any others you want to add to the top).

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>
        Once your pizzas are loaded with toppings, it's time to fire up the grill! Unless you have an outdoor pizza oven (see below), an outdoor grill is your 
        <br>best bet for backyard pizza. Using a pizza stone or steel is going to help you mimic that wood-fired taste. Baking pizza on aluminum foil will also 
        <br>work, but it won't produce quite the same crust.
    </p>

        <li>Insert pizza stone and preheat grill. Place your pizza stone or steel (or a sheet of aluminum foil) directly on the grill grates. 
            Close cover and preheat the grill on high heat.</li>
        <li>Slide pizza into stone. Once the grill is heated, use a pizza peel that is dusted with flour or cornmeal to slide your assembled pizza onto your 
            stone or foil. Close the grill cover.</li>
        <li>Grill the pizza until the crust is browned, about 10 to 12 minutes. Use either a pair of tongs or a pizza peel to remove the pizza from the grill, and slice.</li>
